How to run each solution in your local computer (or fiddle website):

### Level 1 (Python)
- Make sure you have Python installed in your computer
- Open the terminal, go to the solution's folder directory
- Type `python level1.py`

### Level 2 (SQL)
- I have provided the schema and the data in the SQL file
- You can copy and paste the script into any SQL tools that you have in your computer
- After the both of the tables built, go to the query prompt and paste the query script inside the SQL file
- But, to make things easier, I have provided the fiddle
- Go to this URL: http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/bf35d4/8/0
- You can already see the schema and the result from the query script from that fiddle website

### Level 3 (C#)
